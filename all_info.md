Microcontroller:  Web supported card payment system
January 2018
ATMega32A, Nodemcu, RFID card
CSE 316 Microcontrollers and Microprocessors Sessional Final Project 
We have implemented a card based digital monetary system. 
Here we have used an ATmega32A micro controller as our processing unit, ESP8266 Nodemcu v2 as wi-fi module for communicating with the remote java server and an RC-522 RFID module for reading from an RFID card. 
We have also used a 20x4 LCD module for showing prompts and all the inputs are given via a 4x4 keypad.

Multiplayer Game: Chess
September 2019
Java, JavaFX, Socket
A multiplayer chess game built using Java
This is our term project of Level 1 term 2 at BUET
You can create a live chess game, join with a awaiting competitor or watch a live chess game as a spectator
All the matches are saved in memory so that they can be watched later on.
All legal moves of a chess piece are shown on the board
The game ends whenever a checkmate occurs
There can be multiple matches on a single server at any time

Robotics: Automated Arm
December 2017
Arduino Uno,  Matlab, servo motors
We made a fully automated robotic hand that could detect and pick up light-weight boxes and sort them into three different categories according the shape that was printed on the boxes.
The body is made out of PVC boards
Joints are made by 30Kg-cm Metal gear servo motors
A 1080p webcam for capturing live images for box detection
The actuators are controlled by an Arduino Uno
The arduino is controlled from Matlab
Whenever a white box of 10cm X 10cm X 10cm appears in front of the webcam, the arm detects and picks up the box automatically
The arm was configured to detect three shapes (circle, rectangle and triangle) on a single box and is configured to sort the boxes according to the detected shape
